## Description
The Evolutionary Games Toolkit (EGT) is a Matlab toolbox aimed at the study of (obviously) evolutionary
games. EGT provides functions for three types of operations:

1. Simulation
2. Markovian analysis
3. Mean Field Dynamics (MFD) analysis

## Quick Start
EGT has been created with Matlab 2023b; while we have not tested it, it probably works with every Matlab version
after 2020. 

To start using EGT, unzip EGT.zip and you will obtain a root folder EGT with several subfolders. Open
Matlab, go to EGT and first run the script AddMyPath. Next go to subfolder Examples and then to any of its
subfolders Ex0501, ..., Ex0504 and run any of the scripts included in these; each script produces some plots which
show the evolution of strategy usage over several generations of an evolutionary game.
